# TemplateEngine

This application is designed to dynamically generate an html page that contains contact information for a whole team. The user is prompted to enter the information upon initialization. Once the user adds all members of their team, the application dynamically creates a syled html document containing the information they entered.

## Interface
The user simply needs to answer the questions when prompted, and the application will then take over, dynamically creating an html file.
